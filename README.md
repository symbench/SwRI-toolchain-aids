This repository will be to keep anything created to make use of the SwRI toolchain easier.

Batch files are created to make starting the tool easier.  The Desktop files are the top level and will be selected by the tool user.  The other .bat files are used by the Desktop .bat files and were located in the C:/tmp/graphData folder.
